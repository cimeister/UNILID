# UNILID

Fast multilingual language identification using unigram language models. A
shared token vocabulary is trained across languages, each language gets its own
token probability distribution over it, and a text is labeled with the language
that scores it highest (Rust-accelerated, Rayon-parallel batch inference). The
released model covers 1,940 language-script combinations and ships with
calibrated inference (default), per-language decision thresholds that can be
extended one language at a time, and language subsetting for latency-sensitive
deployments.

## Installation

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.9 or newer. The suite is run on 3.9, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14; the Rust extension is an abi3 build, so one compiled extension serves all of them
- A Rust toolchain for the mandatory tokenizers build. With [rustup](https://rustup.rs) there is nothing to choose: the bundled fork pins its toolchain version and rustup fetches it. Without rustup, 1.85 or newer
- cmake and a C++ compiler, only if you build the optional SentencePiece CLI (used by the `sp` training method)

```bash
# Clone with submodules (required for the custom tokenizers)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Ahmetcanyvz/UNILID.git && cd UNILID

# Safe to re-run, and the fix if the clone did not pull the submodule
git submodule update --init tokenizers

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install unilid. This does not install or build the tokenizers extension,
# so prediction needs the build below as well.
pip install -e .

# Check the checkout before building
python doctor.py

# Build the custom tokenizers extension (REQUIRED for inference; standard
# HuggingFace tokenizers will NOT work)
pip uninstall tokenizers -y
pip install maturin
cd tokenizers/bindings/python
unset CONDA_PREFIX  # if using conda
maturin develop --release
cd ../../..

# Should now print "ready"
python doctor.py
```

`python doctor.py` reports the submodule checkout, the Rust version, the
SentencePiece CLI, and whether the built extension has the methods model loading
requires, and prints the fix for whatever is missing. Two build failures it
exists to catch, because neither error message names its own cause:

- A Cargo error about `?` weak dependency features and the nightly channel means
  the toolchain is too old, not that a nightly one is needed. The fork's
  `rust-toolchain` files pin a version, so rustup users do not see this; anyone
  building with a distribution-packaged Rust needs 1.85 or newer.
- A Cargo manifest parse error usually means the `tokenizers` submodule was
  never checked out. Run `git submodule update --init tokenizers`.

Optional extras: `pip install -e ".[train]"` for training (torch, transformers,
sentencepiece, ujson), `pip install -e ".[dev]"` for the test suite
(`python -m pytest tests/`). The suite passes on `[dev]` alone; the two tests
that exercise the SentencePiece training path skip unless both the `spm_train`
binary and the `sentencepiece` package are present, which needs the build in
[Training](#training-a-model) below plus the `[train]` extra.

## Download a pre-trained model

| Model | Languages | Training Data | Calibration | Download |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| unilid-1940-calibrated | 1940 language-script combinations | 60M samples | bundled (version-2 file) | [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/cmeister/unilid-1940) |
| unilid-1940 | 1940 language-script combinations | 60M samples | none (version-1 file) | [polybox](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/Kbb9TWkSSgQ8yoS) |

Both files contain the same trained model; the calibrated file additionally
bundles the calibration artifact (160 KB). The file is 780 MB; loading builds
the float32 weight matrix in memory, so plan for roughly 2 to 3 GB of free RAM.

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
python -c "from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download; \
  print(hf_hub_download('cmeister/unilid-1940', 'unilid-1940-calibrated.unilid', local_dir='.'))"
# or directly:
# wget https://huggingface.co/cmeister/unilid-1940/resolve/main/unilid-1940-calibrated.unilid
```

## Predict

```python
from unilid import load_model

model = load_model("unilid-1940-calibrated.unilid")
lang, tokens, score = model.predict("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
print(lang)  # 'eng_Latn'

texts = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "Der schnelle braune Fuchs springt über den faulen Hund.",
    "Le renard brun rapide saute par-dessus le chien paresseux.",
]
for text, (lang, tokens, score) in zip(texts, model.predict_batch(texts)):
    print(f"{lang}: {text[:50]}")
```

Prediction defaults to **calibrated inference**: a shared constant replaces
each language's unseen-token log-probabilities at load time, and close
decisions that land in two error-prone groups of languages are re-examined
against each language's own threshold. On the GlotLID-C test pool this raises
macro F1 from 0.929 to 0.957. The mechanism, the constants, and the full
measured effects (including the evaluations where calibration lowers a metric)
are described in [REPRODUCING.md](REPRODUCING.md) and specified in the UNILID
paper.

The original release's uncalibrated behavior is one flag away:

```python
base_model = load_model("unilid-1940-calibrated.unilid", calibrated=False)
```

Loading a model that has no calibration artifact (a version-1 `.unilid` file,
including the polybox release and self-trained models) with default arguments
raises `UnilidCalibrationError`; pass `calibrated=False` for such files.

Batch inference uses Rayon and defaults to all CPU cores; limit it with
`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4 python ...`.

## Restrict to a subset of languages

Scoring cost is linear in the number of languages, so restricting the model to
the languages a deployment can actually encounter reduces latency
proportionally (1,940 to 100 languages cuts the scoring loop by roughly 19x).

```python
model = load_model("unilid-1940-calibrated.unilid",
                   languages=["eng_Latn", "deu_Latn", "fra_Latn"])
```

or write a smaller model file once and load it anywhere:

```bash
unilid-calibrate subset unilid-1940-calibrated.unilid -o european.unilid \
    --langs-file my_languages.txt
```

Base (uncalibrated) predictions on a subset are exact: the decision rule is an
argmax over the included languages. Under calibrated inference the
re-examination thresholds are carried over from the full model by default;
because removing languages can only raise a prediction's margin, carried
thresholds make re-examination fire at most as often as calibrated, and
otherwise behave identically. Re-estimating the thresholds against the subset
model is optional: pass `--recalibrate <corpus_dir>` (expects
`<corpus_dir>/<lang>_train.txt` per retained low-resource language) to run the
per-language threshold recipe against the subset.

## Add your own language

A new language can be added to an existing calibrated model without retraining
anything else. A complete runnable walkthrough on toy data ships with the
repository: `bash examples/add_language/run_example.sh` builds a small
calibrated model from scratch, adds a fourth language, and compares predictions
before and after (see
[examples/add_language/README.md](examples/add_language/README.md)).

```bash
unilid-add-language unilid-1940-calibrated.unilid xyz_Latn xyz_train.txt -o extended.unilid
```

```python
from unilid import add_language
summary = add_language("unilid-1940-calibrated.unilid", "xyz_Latn",
                       "xyz_train.txt", "extended.unilid")
```

This trains the new language's token distribution over the model's existing
vocabulary (fixed-vocabulary EM; the default `sp` method needs the SentencePiece
CLI, `--method em` is pure Python), appends its weight row (existing rows are
copied byte-identically), and calibrates it from its own data alone: a
re-examination threshold is estimated from its own training lines when it has
fewer than 18,000 of them, and it becomes a replacement candidate only with at
least 100,000. Three caveats, stated here and in the paper: the four-language
high-entropy group is not recomputed (the one non-incremental piece of the
calibration), existing languages' thresholds are kept, and the 100,000-line
candidate requirement is a per-artifact constant that an uncapped corpus
deployment should choose deliberately.

The new row is put on the same scale as the model's existing rows before it is
stored, and the command prints what it did. Only the probability mass a row
places on tokens that can affect a score is comparable across languages, and a
row carrying more of it than the others scores higher by a constant per
token, for reasons that have nothing to do with the language. Models written before special
tokens were excluded from the distribution hold part of their mass on those
tokens, the released model exactly 0.2 of it, so a freshly trained row is scaled
down to match rather than being given a silent advantage over all 1,940
languages already in the file.

The new language is trained over the base model's existing vocabulary, which
`add_language` cannot extend. A language whose text uses byte values that
vocabulary does not cover has most of its input fall to `<unk>`, and its
accuracy stays poor however much training data it has. For a real language that
means starting from the released 1,940-language model rather than from a small
model of your own: the toy walkthrough's 0.98 comes from a 300-token vocabulary
over constructed data and does not carry over. The third bullet of
[examples/add_language/README.md](examples/add_language/README.md) covers this.

`unilid-calibrate` manages the calibration artifact directly:

| Subcommand | Does |
|------------|------|
| `export MODEL -o cal.json` | Write the bundled calibration to standalone JSON |
| `bundle MODEL cal.json -o OUT` | Attach a calibration to a version-1 model (writes version 2) |
| `estimate MODEL LANG train.txt -o OUT` | Re-estimate one language's threshold |
| `subset MODEL -o OUT --langs ... [--recalibrate DIR]` | Restrict to a language subset |

## Training a model

`train.py` is the single entry point for training a model from scratch. It
loads data, splits per-language corpus files, trains a shared base tokenizer,
re-estimates per-language token probabilities, and saves everything plus a
`training_summary.json`. A model trained this way is a base model with no
calibration artifact; load it with `calibrated=False` (deriving a full
calibration is described in the paper's development-protocol appendix, and
[examples/add_language/build_calibration.py](examples/add_language/build_calibration.py)
shows the bootstrap on a small model).

The default per-language method (`sp`) requires the forked SentencePiece CLI
(both the pip package from the `[train]` extra and the compiled binary):

```bash
git submodule update --init sentencepiece   # not pulled by the install steps above
cd sentencepiece && mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. && make -j$(nproc) && sudo make install   # or -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local
cd ../..
```

Verify with `spm_train --help`, or `python doctor.py`.

Which steps need that binary, exactly. The base tokenizer and the per-language
probabilities are two separate training steps with separate flags:

| Step | Flag | Needs `spm_train` |
|------|------|-------------------|
| Base vocabulary | `--base-training-method hf` (default) or `bpe` | no |
| Base vocabulary | `--base-training-method soft` or `hard` | yes, unless both `--base-seed-vocab hf` and `--base-em-impl custom` are set |
| Per-language | `--per-lang-counts-method sp` (default) | yes |
| Per-language | `--per-lang-counts-method soft` or `hard` | no |

The custom EM base methods use SentencePiece for two sub-steps by default:
suffix-array seeding of the initial vocabulary (`--base-seed-vocab`) and the
maximization step (`--base-em-impl`). Both defaults are `sp`, so
`--base-training-method soft` alone still needs the binary. A missing binary is
an error naming the flag that asked for it, never a silent switch to another
method.

### Input formats

Provide exactly one of `--fasttext`, `--wili-dir`, or `--tsv`.

`--fasttext FILE`: one sample per line, `__label__` plus the language code, a
space, then the text (the format of [GlotLID](https://github.com/cisnlp/GlotLID)
and [FastText LID](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html)):

```
__label__eng Hello world
__label__deu Hallo Welt
```

`--wili-dir DIR`: a directory with aligned `x_train.txt` (texts) and
`y_train.txt` (language codes), as in
[WiLI-2018](https://zenodo.org/record/841984).

`--tsv FILE`: tab-separated `id`, `lang`, `text`, as in
[Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/en/downloads)'s `sentences.csv`.

### Examples

```bash
# GlotLID-format data, 100K vocab, byte-level
python train.py --fasttext data/glotlid/train.txt --vocab-size 100000 \
    --byte-level --max-base-samples-per-lang 10000

# Custom EM for both base and languages, with no SentencePiece binary anywhere
python train.py --wili-dir data/wili/ --vocab-size 50000 \
    --base-training-method soft --base-seed-vocab hf --base-em-impl custom \
    --per-lang-counts-method hard

# Resume a partially completed run
python train.py --fasttext data/train.txt --vocab-size 100000 \
    --results-dir results_100k --reuse-corpus --reuse-base --skip-existing-langs

# Seed the vocabulary from an existing tokenizer (e.g. LLaMA)
python train.py --fasttext data/train.txt --vocab-size 100000 \
    --initial-vocab path/to/llama/tokenizer.json
```

## The .unilid model format

A trained model packs into a single binary file (one file instead of hundreds
of JSON tokenizers, roughly 16x smaller, memory-mapped weights):

```
Header (32 bytes):
  magic "UNILID\x00\x00"; version uint32 (1 = base model; 2 = calibration
  appended); num_langs, vocab_size, base_tok_len, langs_len (uint32); 4
  reserved bytes
Body:
  base_tokenizer JSON; langs JSON array; weights float32[num_langs * vocab_size]
Version 2 only, after the weights:
  calibration_len uint64 little-endian; calibration JSON
```

The stored weights are always the base (unclamped) matrix; the unseen-token
constant is applied at load time when calibrated inference is active, so one
file serves both modes. Package version 0.1.0 rejects version-2 files with an
error rather than silently returning base predictions.

Each row is a distribution over the vocabulary's real tokens. The four special
tokens (`<s>`, `</s>`, `<pad>`, `<unk>`) hold no probability mass: their stored
weights are never read when scoring, because the scorer takes its unknown-token
score from a single model-wide constant and the other three are reachable only
by text containing those literal substrings. Mass placed on them would be mass
taken from the tokens that do decide a prediction, lowering all of them by a
constant. Models trained before version 0.3.0 do carry such mass, the released
1,940-language model exactly 0.8 of every row, which lowers each of its real
tokens by 1.609 nats. That is one reason its unseen-token values sit above the
-27.63 training floor, at a measured median of -17.66, though not the whole
reason: removing the mass moves the median only to -16.05, so most of the gap has
another origin. Those files still load and score exactly as before, and
`add_language` matches their scale when extending them.

Pack, unpack, and bundle:

```bash
unilid-convert results_100k -o my_model.unilid                          # pack (version 1)
unilid-convert results_100k -o my_model.unilid --calibration cal.json   # pack + bundle (version 2)
unilid-convert model.unilid --unpack                                    # unpack (writes calibration.json for version 2)
python convert.py ...                                                   # same pack/unpack arguments
```

`unpack_unilid` writes the bundled calibration to `calibration.json` beside the
tokenizers, and `save_unilid` refuses to repack a directory containing
`calibration.json` unless the calibration is passed explicitly, so a calibrated
model cannot be downgraded to version 1 by accident.

## Evaluation and bulk prediction

`eval.py` streams predictions over a text file or evaluates against labeled
data. It scores in base (uncalibrated) mode and refuses a version-2 model file
unless `--base` is passed; calibrated predictions are produced through the
Python API.

```bash
# Predictions to TSV (text \t lang \t score) or JSONL
python eval.py --model model.unilid --input texts.txt --output predictions.tsv
python eval.py --model model.unilid --input texts.txt --output out.jsonl --format jsonl

# Metrics (accuracy, macro F1/precision/recall, throughput) on fastText-format labels
python eval.py --model model.unilid --input test.txt --fasttext --output results.json
python eval.py --model model.unilid --input test.txt --fasttext --lang-only  # ignore scripts
```

## Python API

Inference:

```python
from unilid import load_model

model = load_model("unilid-1940-calibrated.unilid")            # calibrated (default)
model = load_model("model.unilid", calibrated=False)           # base behavior
model = load_model("model.unilid", calibration="cal.json")     # standalone calibration file
model = load_model("model.unilid", languages=["eng_Latn", "deu_Latn"])  # subset

lang, tokens, score = model.predict("Hello world")
results = model.predict_batch(["Hello world", "Hallo Welt"])

model.num_languages, model.langs        # language inventory
model.calibrated                        # True under the default
model.calibration                       # the loaded Calibration (or None)
model.last_reexamination_stats          # per-group counts of the last batch

tok = model.tokenizer                   # the shared base tokenizer
tok.encode("Hello world").tokens
```

`predict` and `predict_batch` return `(lang, tokens, score)`; under calibrated
inference, `tokens` and `score` are the segmentation and score under the
finally predicted language.

Training and customization:

```python
from unilid import (
    add_language,                       # add one language to a calibrated model
    train_standard_tokenizer,           # one shared tokenizer over languages
    train_language_specific_tokenizer,  # base + per-language distributions
    train_tokmix,                       # merge per-language vocabularies
    save_unilid, unpack_unilid,         # pack/unpack model files
    Calibration, estimate_tau,          # calibration artifact + threshold recipe
)
```

Running the training helpers needs the `[train]` extra; they are imported lazily
so a prediction-only install, and the `[dev]` test suite, work without it.
`CorpusTokenizer`
(`python -m unilid.corpus_tokenizer`) batch-tokenizes corpora with existing
tokenizers. Lower-level trainer classes (`StandardUnigramLMTokenizer`,
`LanguageSpecificUnigramLMTokenizer`, `EMUnigramTrainer`) expose `encode_lang`,
`best_language_encode`, and the EM internals.

## Reproducing the paper's results

[REPRODUCING.md](REPRODUCING.md) maps the released files and modes to the
paper's reported rows, describes the calibrated-inference mechanism in detail,
lists the measured effects on GlotLID-C, UDHR, and CommonLID, and states the
evaluation conventions. The paper is the specification of record.

## Experimental: forward marginalization

`predict` and `predict_batch` accept `forward=True` in base mode, which scores
each language by marginalizing over all segmentations (log-sum-exp) instead of
taking the single best segmentation:

```python
lang, tokens, score = base_model.predict(text, forward=True)   # ~2x slower
```

This mode exists for experimentation; the two decodings give nearly identical
accuracy in practice and there is no established use case where forward
scoring is preferable, so Viterbi (the default) is recommended. `forward=True`
is defined for the base model only and raises under calibrated inference: the
calibration thresholds are percentiles of Viterbi margins, so marginalized
scores would not match them.
